# MediaPlayer

The `MediaPlayer` class provides the core functionality for media playback in Avalonia applications. It handles media
loading, playback control, and platform-specific backend management, serving as the engine behind
the `MediaPlayerControl`.

## Properties

### Media Source Properties

| Property | Type        | Description                                                                 |

## Methods

| Method            | Return Type | Description                                   |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| InitializeAsync() | Task        | Initializes the media player and its backend. |
| PrepareAsync()    | Task        | Prepares the media for playback.              |
| PlayAsync()       | Task        | Starts or resumes media playback.             |
| PauseAsync()      | Task        | Pauses media playback.                        |
| StopAsync()       | Task        | Stops media playback.                         |
| ReleaseAsync()    | Task        | Releases resources for the current media.     |
| UnInitialize()    | Task        | Releases all resources used by the player.    |

## Backend Architecture

The `MediaPlayer` uses a pluggable backend architecture to support different platforms:

The backend selection is automatic based on the platform:

```mermaid
graph TD
    MP[MediaPlayer] --> IMPB[IMediaPlayerBackend]
    IMPB --> AVFB["AVFoundation<br/>(macOS/iOS)"]
    IMPB --> EPB["ExoPlayer<br/>(Android)"]
    IMPB --> VLCB["LibVLC<br/>(Linux)"]
    IMPB --> MFB["Media Foundation<br/>(Windows)"]
    MP:::main
    IMPB:::interface
    MFB:::impl
    AVFB:::impl
    EPB:::impl
    VLCB:::impl
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Playback

```csharp
// Create and initialize
var player = new MediaPlayer();
await player.InitializeAsync();

// Configure
player.Volume = 0.8;
player.LoadedBehavior = MediaPlayerLoadedBehavior.Manual;

// Load and play media
player.Source = new UriSource("https://example.com/audio.mp3");
await player.PrepareAsync();
await player.PlayAsync();
```

### Event Handling

```csharp
// Setup event handlers
player.MediaPrepared += (s, e) => Console.WriteLine("Ready to play");
player.MediaStarted += (s, e) => Console.WriteLine("Playback started");
player.MediaPlaybackCompleted += (s, e) => Console.WriteLine("Playback completed");

// Error handling
player.ErrorOccurred += (s, e) => {
    Console.WriteLine($"Error: {e.ErrorMessage}");
};
```

### Resource Cleanup

```csharp
// Clean up when done
await player.StopAsync();
await player.ReleaseAsync();
await player.UnInitialize();
```

## Error Handling

The MediaPlayer uses an event-based approach to error handling:

- When an error occurs, the player transitions to an Error state internally
- The `ErrorOccurred` event is raised with detailed error information
- Most methods check for the Error state and will not proceed
- Call ReleaseAsync() to reset the error state

```csharp
// Subscribe to error events
player.ErrorOccurred += (sender, args) =>
{
    // Handle the error appropriately here with your custom logic.
    // Reset with ReleaseAsync() elsewhere if you need to playback again.
    // ...
    Console.WriteLine($"Error: {args.Message}");
};

// Try to play media
try {
    await player.PlayAsync();
}
catch (Exception ex) {
    // Fallback exception handling if needed
    if (player.LastErrorMessage != null) {
        Console.WriteLine($"Error: {player.LastErrorMessage}");
        
        // Optionally reset the player
        await player.ReleaseAsync();
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Initialization and Cleanup**:
    - Always call `InitializeAsync()` before using `MediaPlayer`.
    - Call `ReleaseAsync()` between loading different media sources.
    - Call `UnInitialize()` when completely done with `MediaPlayer`.

2. **Error Handling**:
    - Subscribe to the `ErrorOccurred` event to handle playback errors.

3. **Resource Management**:
    - Properly clean up to avoid resource leaks.
    - Consider reusing a single `MediaPlayer` instance for multiple media items that are to be played sequentially.

4. **Platform Considerations**:
    - Test media playback on all target platforms.
