# Community Support

The Avalonia community offers several ways to get help, share knowledge, and connect with other developers. Each platform serves a different purpose to help you get the most effective support for your needs.

## GitHub Discussions 

We encourage developers to ask questions on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/discussions). This is our preferred platform for technical questions because:

* Questions and answers are publicly searchable, helping future developers find solutions
* Complex technical discussions can be properly formatted with code blocks
* Issues can be easily linked to relevant pull requests or documentation
* The community can build a knowledge base over time

GitHub Discussions is ideal for:

* Implementation questions
* Architecture discussions
* Feature requests
* General technical queries

## Community Chats 

While our community chats are a fantastic resource for real-time discussion and quick help, it's important to understand their limitations. Chat platforms, by their nature, are where valuable information often gets lost to time. These conversations aren't indexed by search engines, can't be easily referenced later, and aren't accessible for AI learning systems that could help future developers. This means the same questions often get asked and answered repeatedly, reducing the efficiency of our community's knowledge sharing.

This is why we highly encourage using [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/discussions) as your first destination for questions. By posting on GitHub Discussions, you're not just getting help, you're contributing to a searchable, permanent knowledge base that benefits the entire Avalonia community and ecosystem. 

### Telegram

Access the [Avalonia chat](https://t.me/Avalonia) using the [Telegram app](https://telegram.org/) (recommended for the best experience). Our Telegram community is great for:

* Quick questions specific to your application
* Keeping up with community news and updates
* Real-time troubleshooting
* Networking with other Avalonia developers

You can access the Telegram chat [here](https://t.me/Avalonia).

### C# Discord

Some members of the Avalonia community can also be found in the [GUI channel on the C# Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/143867839282020352/169726357331378176). While this isn't an official Avalonia-specific channel, it can be a helpful resource for:

* General GUI development discussions
* Cross-pollination of ideas with other .NET UI frameworks
* Broader .NET ecosystem conversations

## Best Practices for Getting Help

To get the most effective help:

1. Use GitHub Discussions for general questions that could help others
2. Use community chats for quick, specific questions about your implementation
3. Always include relevant code examples and what you've tried
4. Check the documentation and existing GitHub Discussions first
5. Be specific about which version of Avalonia you're using
